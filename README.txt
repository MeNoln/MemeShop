This is a simple Online store with Admin pannel where you can add/edit/delete items(CRUD). Also it has Discount code to get some sale on your buy. You can also CRUD all discount codes.

Technologies that i was using:
Frontend: HTML, CSS(predominantly Bootstrap 4 to create all Views fast and looking good), JS.
Backend: C#, ASP.NET MVC 5, EF6, Ninject(IoC Container), Automapper.

My goals to this project:
1. To feel my self better when working with multilevel architecture. To understand how Data Access Layer, Bisness Logic Layer, Presentation Layer works.
2. Start using Dependency Injection, IoC.
3. Learn some Aoutomapper features.
4. Create a Web Site with Admin Pannel where person can works with products on his Site.
5. Use some Clean Code tips which i got from Uncle's Bob book Clean Code. 
6. Work with System.IO. Because you need to upload Images to your product and also delete them from Database and from Server folder.

I dont want to write more about this Project, if you are interested you can check code base in this repo.
I was trying to do my best.
